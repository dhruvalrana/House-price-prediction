# House-price-prediction
This Jupyter notebook implements a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices based on the area of the house. Below is a structured overview of its contents:

Data Loading and Visualization:

The dataset House_Price.csv is loaded using Pandas.

A scatter plot is generated to visualize the relationship between Area and Price.

Model Training:

A LinearRegression model from sklearn is trained using the Area as the independent variable (feature) and Price as the dependent variable (target).

The model's coefficient (slope) and intercept are displayed.

Price Prediction:

Predictions are made for specific areas (e.g., 3300 and 5000 sq ft).

A plot is generated showing the regression line fitted to the data points.

Batch Prediction:

Another CSV file named Area.csv is read, containing a list of areas for which price predictions are generated.

The predicted prices are appended to the DataFrame and saved as Area_Price.csv.

Visualization:

The regression line is visualized along with the data points to illustrate the model's fit.

This notebook is a clear demonstration of basic Supervised Learning with linear regression, focused on real estate pricing prediction based on property area.
